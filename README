Calculates the spectrum of a 2D Shiba lattice. The batch file kspect.sh submits the parallelized code using Slurm Workload Manager, run_kspect.m contains the parameters and calls kspect.m to calculate the spectrum. After this the script collect_kspect.m is manually called to collect the data. The script check.py can be used to check which of the batch jobs did not finish.
